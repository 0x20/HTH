# The Roles

## The Board

The role of the board is explained in detail in [the board document](board.md).

## Group Of Members

*The members make and maintain the hacker environment.*

When a conflict/problem can not be resolved between individuals/via do-ocracy or when it impacts the group, a group decision is required.  Any member can request that a decision is made by the Group Of Members instead of by do-ocracy/individual members.

They are responsible for

- Creating and patching the guidelines and the system.
- Solve problems when do-ocracy cannot fix them.
- Elect board, validate membership decisions made by the board.
- Organize workshops, events, lectures.

## Individual members

*The individuals have to be excellent.*

- Follow [Do-ocracy](do-ocracy.md)
- Actively try to fix problems
- Maintain personal safety and that of others
- Follow and enforce the [Guidelines](../guidelines/README.md).

## Non-members

Non-members are also an important part of the space. They can contribute to the hacker environment and they can be potential members. However, non-members have less privileges than members.

- Non-members are only allowed in the space when they are in company of a member. That member is responsible for the actions of the non-member.
- Non-members have to follow the guidelines. A non-member is not allowed to challenge a decision made by the group. If the non-member disagree with a decision made by the group, then they should become a member and bring the topic forward on a meeting.
