# 2. Do-ocracy

## In short

* If you want something done: **Just do it!**
* Have you done something? **Great!, now tell others about it.** Tell them what you did, and why you did it. The mailing-list is a great place to do so. Telling other people about your actions lets them know who to thank and will give you more support.
* If somebody complains: Either **revert it**, or work out a solution with the person who is complaining.

## Vision behind it

A do-ocracy is an organizational structure in which individuals choose to pick up roles and execute tasks by themselves, rather than getting them appointed by others.
Responsibilities are attached to people who do the work, rather than to the elected/selected officials.
Doing a task is in itself justification for you being the person who does that job.

## Boundaries

Some things are too sensitive to be handled by do-ocracy alone, like throwing things away. The guidelines define what the boundaries are of the Do-ocracy. Any member can request that a decision is discussed in the group.
