# Hack The Hackerspace

This will contain a draft of the organizational structure of our hackerspace. This is intended to be place-agnostic information so it can be used by other hackerspaces around the world.

This is divided into 3 parts:

 1. [The Order](https://github.com/0x20/HTH/tree/master/order):   This is a description of the system that will run our hackerspace. You will find the different decision processes and the different entities of the organization.
 2. [The Pact](https://github.com/0x20/HTH/tree/master/pact):   This is the Code of Conduct. This is intended to be a very broad enforced guideline of how members should behave. 
 3. [The Legacy](https://github.com/0x20/HTH/tree/master/legacy): This is all the information we collected during the HTH meetings. This should be used as a cypher to understand the Pact itself. This is to avoid incorrect interpretations of the order and the pact
