# Pact Proposal

The pact == code of conduct. 

Basically we've come the obervation that "use common sense" and "be excellent" don't always suffice as a *code of conduct*. This is because different people have different realities, different values and morals. We think this diversity is a good thing. However in a communal context where these realities clash with eachother it creates friction and conflict. 

So the need for basic rules arose, this is an attempt to define these rules.

Ofcourse the basic rules are a practical emanation the two basic rules: 
* Use common sense
* Be excellent to eachother

Members are encouraged to apply the two basic rules to the best of their abilities. *Be excellent to eachother* implies treating others the way you want to be treated, which is considered by almost all moral systems as [the golden rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule).

##### Throwing things away

Some things that seem a useless waste of space to you, might be very valuable to other people. When you throw things away, it has to be decided upon by the group, via the decision model of the group.
