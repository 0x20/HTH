# Pact Proposal

The pact == code of conduct. 

Basically we've come the obervation that "use common sense" and "be excellent" don't always suffice as a *code of conduct*. This is because different people have different realities, different values and morals. We think this diversity is a good thing. However in a communal context where these realities clash with eachother it creates friction and conflict. 

So the need for basic rules arose, this is an attempt to define these rules.

Ofcourse the basic rules are a practical emanation the two basic rules: 
* Use common sense
* Be excellent to eachother

Members are encouraged to apply the two basic rules to the best of their abilities. *Be excellent to eachother* implies treating others the way you want to be treated, which is considered by almost all moral systems as [the golden rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule).

## Space maintance

### Cleaning
* Keep the dishes clean: when using the dishes clean your dishes and any dishes that are standing there. Whe you see other people using the dishes, and they forget cleaning them, give them a gentle reminder. 
* Keep the desks clean, feel free to use the deskspace for your stuff, you can leave your stuff on the desk when you just 'pop out for some food', but leave a note stating wshen you'll be back. _Do Not_ leave it for the next morning. 
* Remove empty packaging, from food or beverages. If you are the last person to leave the space, it's your resposibility to clean up. If you see people leaving, please alert them if they have left their trash in the space.
* Every once in a while there will be a cleaning day in the space, as an good upstanding member of the community you should attend one of these at least once quarterly. Lots of hands make light work.

### Throwing things away
*Some things that seem a useless waste of space to you, might be very valuable to other people. When you throw things away, it has to be decided upon by the group, via the decision model of the group.

### Tool Maintance
* When you are using tools/infrastructure from the space, you are effectively borrowing that item from the community. 
* Return borrowed items promptly in the same or better condition than when borrowed.
* If you borrow it, return it. If it breaks, fix it. If you lose it, replace it.
* So when using something, clean it afterwards and put it back in it's place.
