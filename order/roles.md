# Core group

* The core group enables the hacker environment to exist. 
* The core group should be as "thin layer" as possible. Core group should operate mostly in the background. If the core group does a good job,     they should be invisible.
* In the current legal structure (VZW) the board members carry the end-responsibility. So the core group can only contain the same people that are appointed board-member during the general assembly. This way the people taking the decision are also liable and vice-versa,
no people can take decision without needing to take responsibility for it.
* Reposibilities: 
  * Finance     
  * Core infrastructure  
  * `if ($conflict && ( $conflict.type == "harrasment" || $conflict.type == "safety" ))`
    => in human language = If the conflict AND conflict type is harrasment OR safety
