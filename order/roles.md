# Core group

* The core group enables the hacker environment to exist. 
* The core group should be as "thin layer" as possible. Core group should operate mostly in the background. If the core group does a good job,     they should be invisible.
* In the current legal structure (VZW) the board members carry the end-responsible. So the core group can only contains the same people that are appointed board-member during the general assembly. This way the people taking the decision must also take the responsible and vice-versa,
no people can take decision without needing to take responsibility for it.

 - Finance     
 - Core infrastructure  
 - `if ($conflict && ( $conflict.type == "harrasment" || $conflict.type == "safety" ))`
