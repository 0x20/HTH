# Core group

*The core group exists to enable the hacker environment to exist. Apart from that, they should be indistinguishable from normal members.*

In the current legal structure (VZW) the board members carry the end-responsibility. So the core group can only contain the same people that are appointed board-member during the general assembly. This way the people taking the decision are also liable and vice-versa,
no people can take decision without needing to take responsibility for it.

The core group is responsible for

  * Finance     
  * Core infrastructure (including safety of core infrastructure)
  * Extreme conflict between members such as harassment
  * Communication about these things with Group Of Members

This does not mean that the core group has to do everything themselves. They can "outsource" tasks to other people. However, the core group has to check if these tasks are done properly.

The core group can temporarily ban people from the space as a means of enforcing their responsibility. If they do that, however, they have to send a notice to all members, explaining what they did and why. In the next meeting, the problem has to be discussed so the group can decide upon a permanent solution.

In certain sensitive cases, like harassment and conflict between individual members, it is advised that the core group sits down with the concerning parties and tries to find a resolution. When a resolution is found, and it concerns the Group Of Members, the core group proposes the resolution to the Group Of Members. The Group Of Members then has to approve the proposal.
      
# Group Of Members

*The members make and maintain the hacker environment.*

When a conflict/problem can not be resolved between individuals/via do-ocracy or when it impacts the group, a decision is required by the group. Any member can request that a decision is made by the Group Of Members instead of by do-ocracy/individual members.

They are responsible for

 - Creating and patching Pact and the Order (in general assembly)
 - Solve problems when do-ocracy cannot fix them
 - Elect board, validate membership decisions made by the board.
 - Organize workshop, events, lectures.

# Individual members

*The individuals have to be excellent.*

 - Follow [Do-ocracy](do-ocracy.md)
 - Actively try to fix problems
 - Maintain personal safety and that of others
 - To follow and enforce the [Pact](../pact/README.md).

# Non-members

Non-members are also an important part of the space. They can contribute to the hacker environment and they can be potential members. However, non-members have less privileges than members.

 - Non-members are only allowed in the space when they are in company of a member. That member is responsible for the actions of the non-member.
 - Non-members have to follow the Pact. A non-member is not allowed to challenge a decision made by the group. Does the non-member disagree with a decision made by the group, then he/she should become a member and bring the topic forward on a meeting.
