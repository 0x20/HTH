# Core group

* The core group enables the hacker environment to exist. 
* The core group should be as "thin layer" as possible. Core group should operate mostly in the background. If the core group does a good job, they should be invisible.
* The core group are the same people that are appointed board-member during the general assembly. No non-board members are allowed so that each person that has a vote shares equal responsibility.

 - Finance     
 - Core infrastructure  
 - `if ($conflict && ( $conflict.type == "harrasment" || $conflict.type == "safety" ))`
