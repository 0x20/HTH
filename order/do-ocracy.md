# Do-ocracy

A do-ocracy is an organizationonal structure in which individuals choose to pick up roles and execute tasks by themselves, rather than getting them appointed by others.
Responsilbilities are attach to people who do the work, rather than to the elected/selected officials.
Doing a task is in itself justification for you being the person who does that job.
