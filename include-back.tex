% This file contains latex code that should be added at the front of the
% generated latex document. This is done by using the pandoc command line
% option `--include-before-body=include-cover.tex'
%
% Note that, in order for this to work, \usepackage{pdfpages} also
% needs to be added to the header of the latex document. This is done
% in pandoc-metadata.yaml
%
\includepdf[pages=-]{back.pdf}  % include the cover PDF
